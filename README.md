# Antipodes-Visualizer

This app is to locate and display an entered location's antipode.
Implemented MapBox API(https://www.mapbox.com) with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adjusted for tablet. 

Using Axios, two steps were achieberd in this app from MapBox API: 
1.) foward geocoding: to translate entered city name / address into latitude and longitude; 
2.) reverse geocoding: to display the later converted antipodes' coordinates into

Installation Instruction:
Map Box API keys might need updates in the future.

Unsolved Problems:
At times MapBox unable to load the cat icon for located antipode.
